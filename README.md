- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @SebnemK

I've worked as a computer programmer for an insurance company in Turkey for 16 years. I wrote codes in RPG: IBM's proprietary programming language for AS400/OS400.
I knew basics for Java and .Net back then but of course because I had not used them, I have no knowledge of them anymore... 
I was the head of the IT testing team for a year and then head of the IT Qaulity Assurance for a year before I quit. This was in 2015.
I gave a break to work, went to Italy for a masters degree in Digital Humanities, left the masters after 1,5 years and came back to Izmir, Turkey.
At the moment I'm enjoying my time learning :)

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Python, NLP, Web Scraping, Full Stack Web Development = HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Angular, Node js, Git-Github, Web Design...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Html, Css, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Python
