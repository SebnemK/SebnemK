- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shebnem Kabadayi,

I've worked as a computer programmer for an insurance company in Turkey for 16 years. I wrote codes in RPG/ILE RPG: IBM's proprietary programming language for AS400/OS400, attended courses on Java, .Net, SQL and I've been a team member and team leader at all levels of SDLC.
I was the head of the IT testing team for a year and then head of the IT Qaulity Assurance for a year before I quit. This was in 2015.
I gave a break to work, have been to Italy for a Masters degree in Digital Humanities for 1,5 years and came back to Izmir, Turkey.
At the moment I'm enjoying my time learning :)
